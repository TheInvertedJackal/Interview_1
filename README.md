# GE Interview

## Problems to Solve
The topic of the homework research project is:

* Convolution operation
* Computational complexity of the convolution operation
* How to reduce computational complexity and improve performance of the convolution operation using Fast Fourier transform
* Please implement 2D convolution with direct implementation and using Fast Fourier transform and use performance results of your program to support your paper analysis.
* Please summarize your research in a presentation and be ready to present it in 15 min
